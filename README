To install and run the little Perl hack "Naive Bayes", install

cpan Algorithm::NaiveBayes

and run:

./naivebayes.pl auf.

The Ruby script can be run as

./kmeans.rb

and needs the Ruby gem "kmeans", which can easily be installed via

gem install kmeans


The (as usal extremely short) R script "r-weather.R" requires the two
packages:

install.packages('xts')
install.packages('lubridate')

When it comes to Python's SciPy/NumPy/Pandas stack, it gets more complicated.
Run the script itself via

./pandas-weather.py

BUT: You'll need either Pandas/ScyPy/NumPy via your distribution's packages OR
the ready-made "Anaconda": https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ or
alternatively "Canopy" of Enthought:
https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/
